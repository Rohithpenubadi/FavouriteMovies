        The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring
        Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as
        Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the
        same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being
        homeless.The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside
        the daycare facility his son attended.The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.
